\title{multipoolR: Multipool QTL Mapping in R}
\description{
A comprehensive package to perform multipool QTL scans using a Kalman filter
approach, permutation testing for significance (calculating q-values via FDR),
yeast gene annotation for significant QTLs, and genome-wide visualization of results.
Adapted from the original Python implementation by Edward and Giffords.

\section{Main Function}{

\code{\link{multipool}}
}

\section{Data Format}{

Input data (either files or data frames) should contain columns:
\describe{
   \item{chr}{Chromosome identifier (e.g., "chrI", "chrII"). Must be consistent between pools.}
   \item{pos}{Genomic position (numeric).}
   \item{a}{Read count supporting allele 'A' (numeric).}
   \item{b}{Read count supporting allele 'B' (numeric).}
}
}

\section{Algorithm Details}{

The core algorithm uses a Kalman filter and smoother to estimate the underlying
allele frequency trajectory along the genome for each pool, accounting for
recombination and sampling variance. LOD scores are calculated based on the
likelihood ratio comparing a model with a QTL at a specific location versus
a null model (no QTL), maximized over possible true allele frequencies using numerical optimization.
Genome-wide permutation tests can be performed to estimate empirical p-values and q-values (False Discovery Rate).
